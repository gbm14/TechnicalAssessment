Created database in Azure emulating EnergyCap BBDD. Very basic BBDD to continue developing fast the project.

connectionString for ADO.NET --> Server=tcp:technicalassessmentgbm14.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=TechnicalAssesmentBBDD;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=gbm14;Password=Qwerty123456;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;

***** FINAL SPEECH ******
I have been working for 4 hours and I have exceed by technical test. My final project is dissapointing. It doesn't work and I have not implemented even one of the required parts. 

The truth is I have been working since my first job in maintenance projects. A lot of them in .Net but I have never created the resources or configured them. Before start the test and during it I have had a lot of ideas and as I knew I just had one option to impress you I have tried to do some new things.

Finally I get blocked loading the context of the database in the entity framework. 

This is the cruelty true, I know I can do it, I know I can be the best but I need a lot of formation. I'm going to start to study for the next opportunity I will have.

My main idea for the project was the next originally:
- Create the database in SQL Server with MicrosoftAzure Serverless mode.
- Implement all the interactions between database and backend in NetCore (I have always used NetFramework but I had to try it).
- Create an Azure Web Service (serverless too) in MicrosoftAzure to load all the information from GitHub to Azure Sql Server Database. On this way we only need to access this API one time when the user connects to the application and one more each time the user refresh the information. This is very useful to avoid unnecessary costs because you don't need to waste time and money on infrastructures and you only pay for the connections to the webService that would be very few connections.
- Finally the front was going to be on html, CSS and Javascript. I was focus on back because front maybe is my weakest point because I have not used it for a years.

As you can see I had a lot of ideas, I tried to do some interesting things and finally I failed. But I think I'm proud of I have learned more in four hours than in four years in consulting companies changing from project to project and performing maintenance tasks without remembering what I really like and what I have been preparing for during my studies.

I hope that I have not wasted much of your time and I appreciate the opportunity and interest. I am definitely going to go back to my studies and improve my skills to try to fix my situation.
